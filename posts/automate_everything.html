</div><div class="blog-post__content"><p>I work on an automation team for one of the largest telecoms in the country, so
it should come as no surprise that I have a great deal of affection for automation and
shortcuts.</p>
<p>Actually, that&#39;s downplaying it -- the truth is, <strong>I automate everything that I can think
of, and you should too</strong>.  I obsess over my Ansible playbooks and spend way too much time optimizing
my Gruntfiles.  My friends and coworkers are baffled by how much time I spend
tweaking every aspect of my workflow, so that every contact point is as optimized
as possible.</p>
<p>People familiar with MMORPGs will know that some players are derisively regarded as
&quot;clickers.&quot;  This means that they use their mouse to activate all of their character&#39;s
abilities instead of using the corresponding keyboard shortcut.  Clicking is slow.  Clicking 
makes you slow.  Clicking makes you lose.  The keyboard is faster.</p>
<p>Think about how much time you spend doing mundane tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Want to be a faster developer?  Here&#39;s a few suggestions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Work with servers?  Use some kind of configuration management and provisioning tool.  I use Ansible, but 
you should choose the tool that works for you.  But use something.  If you don&#39;t, you&#39;re slow, and you&#39;re
wasting time that otherwise could be spent working on your product or doing something fun.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a Mac?  Replace Spotlight with Alfred.  Spotlight is junk.  You can do lots of things with Alfred, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Dash to make documentation searches ultra-fast because they&#39;re cached locally and easily searchable.</li>
<li>Use 1Password to generate long randomized passwords and log into your accounts with a command like <code>1p amazon</code>.</li>
<li>The fastest &quot;I&#39;m feeling lucky&quot; searches possible, like <code>l golang</code>.  Think about how often you click the first Google link.  Replace
that with <em>I&#39;m feeling lucky</em>.</li>
<li>Create Evernote notes -- try to make one for everything that you feel could be faster, and come back and automate it.</li>
<li>Move windows around your screen with your keyboard.</li>
<li>... and lots more.  Make workflows for everything.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Use vim?  Use Chrome&#39;s Vimium extension.  It&#39;ll give you Vim keybinds in your browser.  <code>10j</code> all day.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your mouse is slow.  Strive to not use it, and you&#39;ll be faster.  Once you&#39;ve conquered that, reduce your number of keystrokes and 
then you&#39;ll achieve automation nirvana.</p>
