  <h6>I'm a web developer.</h6>
  <p>I hack on internal automation tools, mostly on the web, for a very
  large media and communications company.  My interests include
  functional programming, data visualization, networking, and typography.
  My weapons of choice are JavaScript, Clojure(Script), and Go.  I write
  code with Vim on OSX.</p>
