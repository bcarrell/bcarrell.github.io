      <h2 class="post-content__title">A Brief Primer On Functional Thinking</h2><p>Learning functional programming can be a daunting task.  On your quest for enlightenment, you&#39;re likely to be bombarded
with a slew of new, unfamiliar terms like <em>currying</em> and <em>higher-order functions</em> and <em>partial application</em> and <em>referential transparency</em>.
The first thing you should know about functional programming is that it has a very simple, intuitive definition, and that most (all?) of these new, scary words can be regarded as
techniques to achieve the goal of functional programming, but they do not define what functional programming is.  The primary characteristic
of functional code is simply this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Functional code is code which does not modify or rely upon the surrounding environment.  That is, <strong>purely functional code is
code without side-effects</strong>.  Functional thinking requires the programmer to regard side-effects as poison and take as
many steps as possible to minimize it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In practice, most codebases that regard themselves as functional contain side-effecting functions.  Side effects are everywhere:
database connections or file reading and writing.  But functional code seeks to minimize that and employs a lot of techniques
you may have read about to achieve that: maps, reductions, composability, referential transparency, and
many more.</p>
<p>Functional thinking prefers you to consider your data in an <em>elemental</em> way.</p>
<p>Instead of...</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var myArray = [&#39;learning&#39;, &#39;functional&#39;, &#39;code&#39;];
var upcaseify = String.prototype.toUpperCase;

for (var i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) {
  myArray[i] = upcaseify.call(myArray[i]);
}

console.log(myArray);
// [ &#39;LEARNING&#39;, &#39;FUNCTIONAL&#39;, &#39;CODE&#39; ]</code></pre>
<p>Prefer this...</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">var myArray = [&#39;learning&#39;, &#39;functional&#39;, &#39;code&#39;];
var upcaseify = function(s) {
  return String.prototype.toUpperCase.call(s);
};

myArray = myArray.map(upcaseify);
console.log(myArray);
// [ &#39;LEARNING&#39;, &#39;FUNCTIONAL&#39;, &#39;CODE&#39; ]</code></pre>
<p>See the difference?</p>
<p>In the first example, we&#39;re muddying our thoughts of the problem.
We&#39;re distracting our primitive monkey brains with secondary concepts like managing indices
or lengths of the array when really all we want to do is take a <em>collection</em> of things and do <em>something</em> to
each one.  As long as we can perform an operation to one thing, we can perform that operation
on many things that fit the same criteria.  We don&#39;t care about the
size of the collection or any other properties about it, because we framed our thought at the elemental level.</p>
<p>Of course, the example above yields a lot of other benefits that might not immediately jump at you.
The map example demonstrates immutability.  The looping construct modifies each element in the existing instance of the array.  The map function
creates a new array and replaces the existing array with an entirely new one.  This has a lot of very
important benefits that you will discover later.</p>
<p>Gaining the benefits of functional programming doesn&#39;t require you to <code>rm -rf</code> your entire codebase and start over.  Instead, start
small.  Use <code>map</code> instead of looping constructs.  Write small functions that you can build larger systems with.  When you need an
aggregate over a collection, don&#39;t create a <code>sum</code> variable and add to it, use a reduction.  Think with values, group those values into
logical collections, and apply functions across those values by thinking in an elemental way.</p>
